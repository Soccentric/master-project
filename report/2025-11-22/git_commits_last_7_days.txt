    Add conditional FSBL overrides, boot file mapping, and recipe skips for Xilinx Zynq board configuration
    
    The board configuration is updated to use a conditional FSBL dependency syntax tied to the core image, ensuring correct extra image dependencies. A new IMAGE_BOOT_FILES entry defines required boot artifacts for the zub1cg-sbc-base target. Additionally, a skip_recipes section lists several recipes to be excluded due to deprecated git protocols, missing branch parameters, or invalid license specifications, enhancing build reliability.
    
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/xilinx-zynq.yml : Updated fsbl_override with conditional dependency, added IMAGE_BOOT_FILES entry, and introduced skip_recipes block to omit problematic recipes.

    Correct fsbl_override syntax for ZUB1CG SBC base in Xilinx Zynq board configuration
    
    The fsbl_override section in the Xilinx Zynq board YAML was incorrectly formatted as a simple string with a colon in the variable assignment. This commit restructures the block to introduce a dedicated key (zub1cg-sbc-base) and uses proper assignment syntax, ensuring Yocto parses the EXTRA_IMAGEDEPENDS correctly. This fix improves build reliability for the ZUB1CG SBC variant.
    
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/xilinx-zynq.yml : changed fsbl_override from a plain string to a keyed block with proper assignment syntax for EXTRA_IMAGEDEPENDS.

    Skip Xilinx tools sanity check and add FSBL extra image dependencies for Zynq board
    
    The update disables the meta‑xilinx tools sanity check for the xilinx_standalone configuration and introduces a new fsbl_override section that specifies additional image dependencies required for the zub1cg‑sbc, including libyaml-native, python3‑cython-native, python3‑pyyaml-native, trusted‑firmware‑a, virtual/bootloader, u‑boot‑xlnx‑scr and avnet‑boot‑scr. This ensures proper build ordering and avoids unnecessary sanity failures.
    
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/xilinx-zynq.yml : added SKIP_META_XILINX_TOOLS_SANITY_CHECK flag and introduced fsbl_override with EXTRA_IMAGEDEPENDS for zub1cg-sbc.

    Add support for Zub1CG SBC Base board and rename meta-petalinux repository to meta‑avnet
    
    The Zub1CG SBC Base board is now recognized by the Xilinx Zynq build system. Its architecture mapping and machine list entries are added. Additionally, the meta‑petalinux repository entry in xilinx‑zynq.yml is renamed to meta‑avnet to reflect the upstream source, while keeping the same URL, branch, and path.
    
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/.arch-map : added zub1cg-sbc-base entry with aarch64 architecture
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/.machines : added zub1cg-sbc-base to the machine list
    * boards/xilinx-zynq/xilinx-zynq.yml : renamed repository key from meta-petalinux to meta-avnet, preserving URL, branch, and path

    Add common package options and default sudo users across all board configurations
    
    This update expands the default package handling by enabling ipk and deb formats alongside rpm, switches the init system to sysvinit, and introduces a common package list (vim, git, htop, openssh, sudo). It also adds a default user with sudo privileges for each supported board (jetson, imx, pi, xilinx). These changes simplify image customization and provide immediate administrative access on target devices.

    Replace inline Python variant logic with Yocto conditional appends in common.yml
    
    The patch removes embedded Python anonymous functions used to set IMAGE_FEATURES, INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP, and INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT for the debug variant and to add read‑only‑rootfs and ptest‑pkgs for the production variant. Instead it uses Yocto's conditional variable appends, making the configuration clearer, reducing runtime Python evaluation and aligning with best practices. This change simplifies variant handling while preserving existing behavior.

    Delete .builderrc.example file from the repository
    Removed the example Builder configuration file; it is no longer needed in the source tree.
    The example was redundant because users can generate a .builderrc directly or use the provided template elsewhere.
    Eliminating the file reduces clutter and the risk of developers accidentally using outdated defaults.
    Keeping only the active configuration file (.builderrc) streamlines maintenance and documentation.

    - Included 'build/', 'sources/', and 'artifacts/' to ignore various build artifact directories.
    - Added '.build-history/' to exclude history logs generated by the build system.
    - Added '.builderrc' to ignore user-specific configuration files.
    - Ignored temporary files with '*.tmp', '.kas-temp.yml', and '/tmp/' patterns.
    - Added editor backup patterns '*~', '*.swp', '*.swo', and '.*.sw?' to prevent backup files from being tracked.
    - Added IDE workspace patterns '.vscode/', '.idea/', and '*.iml' to keep IDE-specific files out of version control.
    - Included OS-specific hidden files '.DS_Store' and 'Thumbs.db' to avoid cluttering the repository.
    - Updated Makefile to introduce a new 'why-failed' target for diagnosing build failures.
    - Implemented argument parsing to require a build name and call scripts/analyze-errors.sh with that name.
    - Added error handling for missing or invalid arguments, providing a clear usage message.
    - Declared the target as .PHONY to avoid accidental file conflicts.

    Add history and stats targets to the Makefile to enable quick inspection of build history data
    
    - Add a new phony target `history` that clears the screen and runs `./scripts/build-history.sh show` to display the build history. This allows developers to view recent builds directly from the Makefile without manually running the script.
    - Add a new phony target `stats` that clears the screen and runs `./scripts/build-history.sh stats` to generate statistics about the build history. This provides a convenient way to see metrics such as build frequency or failure rates.
    - Declare both `history` and `stats` as phony targets using `.PHONY` to prevent conflicts with files of the same name and to ensure the commands always run.
    - The new targets are inserted after the existing `version` target to maintain logical grouping of informational commands within the Makefile.
    - No other Makefile changes were made, so the overall build logic remains unchanged. These additions enhance developer ergonomics by exposing build history functionality directly through `make history` and `make stats`.

    Add build history tracking system to the build pipeline.
    
    - Updated Makefile (lines 153–191) to call a new helper script at the start of each build, passing the family, machine, target, and build variant. This records a “start” event for later analysis.
    - Added calls to the helper script after build completion: on success it logs a “SUCCESS” event with start time and on failure it logs a “FAILED” event, both including the duration. These additions make it possible to audit individual build outcomes and durations directly from the Makefile.
    - Created a new executable script `scripts/build-history.sh` (mode 755). The script parses arguments for “start” or “end” actions, records timestamps, machine and target details, and writes structured entries into a history log file. It ensures the log directory exists, validates inputs, and handles errors gracefully. This script centralizes history collection so future tooling can read and analyze build results.
    - Included descriptive comments and a shebang in the new script, and ensured it is part of the repository and executable.
    
    These changes collectively enable automated tracking of build attempts, durations, and results for monitoring and diagnostics.

    Simplified the `build` target by replacing in‑place validation of family, machine and target with a call to the new helper script `./scripts/validate-target.sh`.
    Removed explicit checks for the existence of `family.yml` and the listing of available families.
    Eliminated the manual grep against `/.machines` to verify supported machines, now handled by the validation script.
    Deleted the manual grep against `/.targets` for target support; the script now reports any unsupported values.
    Updated the `sdk` target similarly: replaced all duplicate validation logic with a single script invocation.
    Cleaned up unused `yml_file` variable and related code blocks, reducing clutter and potential for divergence.
    Maintained the same error‑exit behavior; the script exits with status 1 on failure, preserving original control flow.
    Updated Makefile comments and formatting to reflect the new validation strategy.

    Add .gitignore file to ignore shared/ directory, preventing local artifacts from being tracked.
    Introduce a comprehensive Makefile (v2.0.0) that defines core build variables: SHELL, BUILD_DIR, BOARDS_DIR, SOURCES_DIR, ARTIFACTS_DIR, SHARED_DIR, etc.
    Set default Docker image to master-builder:latest and specify workspace mount path.
    Add VERSION and TIMESTAMP variables to produce reproducible, time‑stamped build identifiers.
    Define flexible build configuration options: BUILD_VARIANT (default release), BB_NUMBER_THREADS, PARALLEL_MAKE, and RM_WORK.
    Create REQUIRED_TOOLS list and CHECK_TOOLS macro to validate presence of docker and git before any build action.
    Construct a DOCKER_RUN command with network host, volume mount, working directory, user ID mapping, and comprehensive proxy environment handling for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and NO_PROXY.
    Enable .ONESHELL so multi‑line commands execute in a single shell, simplifying complex build steps.
    Use $(shell pwd) to set GIT_ROOT dynamically, ensuring paths remain correct regardless of invocation location.
    Implement shared directories for downloads and sstate-cache under shared/, organizing external dependencies and state.
    Configure parallelism based on processor count, allowing the build to scale with available cores.
    Provide an RM_WORK flag to automatically clean the build area when set, aiding reproducibility.
    Structure the Makefile to follow GNU make conventions, ensuring clear output during tool checks.
    Include placeholders for further Docker run options and build logic (truncated in the diff) to allow future expansion.
    Overall, this commit adds the essential scaffolding for a reproducible, Docker‑based KAS board build system.
